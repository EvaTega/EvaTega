#### Hello World!

I recently embarked on my journey in the field of data scientist. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work both individually and collaboratively a fantastic team. We all brought different levels of experetise to the table (or to the screen 😎) which allowed us to learn from one another, not just in terms of technical skills, but also soft skills related to teamwork.

I find fascinating to extract pattenrs and insights from large dataset and to be able to translate those findings into meaninful statistics and ilustrative, relevant graphics. That's why, as a junior, I'm currently focusing on this, which I consider a first and basic step. Once I star to master this, I'll will see how I feel about it and whether I want to go deeper on it or move foward to machine learning models.

For now, I just know there is a lot to explore and discover in this field, as many branches of this IT world would are interesting to me.
