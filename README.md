#### Hello World!

Recently embarked on my journey in the field of data scientist. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work both individually and collaboratively a fantastic team. We all brought different levels of experetise to the table (or to the screen) which allowed us to learn from one another, not just in terms of technical skills, but also soft skills related to teamwork.

I find fascinating to extract pattenrs and insights from large dataset and to be able to translate those findings into meaninful statistics and ilustrative, relevant graphics. That's why, as a junior, I'm currently focusing on this, which I consider a first and basic step. Once I star to master this, I'll will see how I feel about it and whether I want to go deeper on it or move foward to machine learning models.

For now, I just know there is a lot to explore and discover in this field, as many branches of this IT world would are interesting to me.
